## About Me

### Ezekiel Angbashim Kigbo Jr.

<mailto:theatlasroom@gmail.com> / [@theatlasroom](http://twitter.com/theatlasroom) / [eakigbo.me](http://eakigbo.me)

I am a keen web designer/developer interested in utilising cutting edge tools and techniques to deliver the best possible user experiences.

Through various projects both for work and personally, I have had access to many aspects of web developemnt including requirements gathering, user interface design, maintenance and upgrading of existing systems and front and back end development with a wide range of tools and environments.

I have taken particular interest in front end web design and development and am constantly looking for opportunities to seek out and incorporate cutting edge technology to help design the simplest and most effective experiences for clients.

Some of the skills I have acquired and continually look to improve include:

* User focused design
* Front &amp; back end web development
* Developing Standards based / Cross browser / Accessible websites
* Database design
* Developing for mobile devices / Responsive design
* Applications programming
* Verbal and written communication
* Time management / Organization
* Working with Microsoft office suite (or similar)
* Working with Adobe CS products
* Customer service	

I also enjoy pursuing my passion for photography, audio experimentation as [The Atlas Room](http://soundcloud.com/theatlasroom) and football (soccer). Of particular interest, I am excited at the unique experiences that can be created from the synthesis of computer programming with sound, images and the real world.
